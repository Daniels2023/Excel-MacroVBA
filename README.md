Excel-MacroVBA

This VBA code is designed to analyze stock market data across multiple worksheets in an Excel workbook. The code calculates the yearly change, percentage change, and total volume for each stock ticker and highlights positive and negative yearly changes in green and red, respectively. Additionally, the code identifies the stock ticker with the greatest percentage increase, greatest percentage decrease, and greatest total volume across all worksheets.

Using the VBA code:

Make sure that your Excel workbook contains at least one worksheet with stock market data formated in the same way of this excel worksheet in the columns A to G.
Open the VBA editor by pressing Alt + F11.
Insert a new module and paste the code into the module.
Press F5 or select Run from the menu to execute the code.
The code will populate each worksheet with calculated data and identify the top performers in the "Ticker" and "Value" columns of a new summary worksheet.

Considerations:

This code was tested in a limited amount of data, and excels files. It is important to double check if the values are matching what you are expecting.
